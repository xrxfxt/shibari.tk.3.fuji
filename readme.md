## [TK Mt. Fuji - Gote Shibari - TheDuchy](https://www.theduchy.com/gote-shibari/#mt-fuji-3tk)

<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-01.jpg" title="1. This variant begins in a slightly different place than the other 3TKs. Instead of locking off your Kannuki, to the center line, begin this immediately after bringing the tail through the arm after your last Kannuki." />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-02.jpg" title="2. …and lock it off with a Crossing Hitch directly to the back of the lower strap. To begin, run the tail up" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-03.jpg" title="3. Reach under the strap with your fingers on the side of the tail closer to the center line.. In order to have the Crossing Hitches facing the right way so that the tension tends to keep them closed and locked, always start them this way–with your fingers on the side of the rope closer to the center line/core of your partner’s body." />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-04.jpg" title="4. Now put your fingers under the strap on the opposite side of the knot" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-05.jpg" title="5. Grab the tail…" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-06.jpg" title="6. …and pull it through" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-07.jpg" title="7. Repeat this procedure to put a second Crossing Hitch on the next strap up" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-08.jpg" title="8. This one will be a little closer to the center line. We will be running the tail over the opposite shoulder, so it generally follows that path" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-09.jpg" title="9. Run the tail over the opposite shoulder" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-10.jpg" title="10. …then straight down, on the inside of the Kannuki. Then begin running the tail around your partner’s back under the arms…" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-11.jpg" title="11. …across the lower back–between the wrist and the back–to the other side" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-12.jpg" title="12. …to the other side. Be sure to pull it tight so that it slips between your partner’s wrists and back and comes up to run parallel right next to the lines of the lower Kannuki. You can see the line we are working with as the lowest of the horizontal ropes on my partner’s back in this picture" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-13.jpg" title="13. You might need to help the line get up where it needs to be, no worries" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-14.jpg" title="14. Now run the tail up on the inside of the Kannuki up to the shoulder" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-15.jpg" title="15. Run the tail to the back, crossing the other shoulder strap. Place you fingers under the strap on the side closest to your partner’s core. Grab the tail" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-16.jpg" title="16. Lay the tail over the incoming line" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-17.jpg" title="17. …and then under the crossing line to form another Crossing Hitch" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-18.jpg" title="18. Add another Crossing Hitch to lock down the upper strap. If you like symmetry, you can use a Reverse Crossing Hitch here. It will then mirror the other side. I provide details on creating the Reverse Crossing Hitch in the X3TK section." />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-19.jpg" title="19. Lock the tail to the lower strap with another Crossing Hitch" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-20.jpg" title="20. Reach under between the arm and body from the front and grab the tail" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-21.jpg" title="21. Pull the tail through and begin running it across the chest" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-22.jpg" title="22. Reach under the opposite shoulder strap and grab the tail" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-23.jpg" title="23. Pull it through" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-24.jpg" title="24. Reverse the tension and run it to the other shoulder strap" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-25.jpg" title="25. Reach under the shoulder strap from the chest side. Grab the tail" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-26.jpg" title="26. Pull through and add some tension. This will pull the shoulder straps away from the shoulders a little, making them more comfortable and pulling them away from the nerves that run there." />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-27.jpg" title="27. Some riggers leave the ropes simply crossed here…" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-28.jpg" title="28. But many like to add a little twist here. …makes it look a little more like the top of a volcano… a la Mt Fuji…" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-29.jpg" title="29. Bring the tail to the back on the inside of the Kannuki" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-30.jpg" title="30. Bring the tail under the center line…" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-31.jpg" title="31. … so that all the lines from the Kannuki and the Mt Fuji are on the same side of the center line" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-32.jpg" title="32. And from here lock off with a Square Friction. Reverse tension…" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-33.jpg" title="33. …Under" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-34.jpg" title="34. …Over…Under" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-35.jpg" title="35. Pull tightly until the friction is very solid" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-36.jpg" title="36. Now tie it off. I have about 12″ (30cm) of rope left, so I chose to run it over the center line and under the right-hand side of the Kannuki strap again, and then I wrapped one strand around and around the lower strap and then tucked the ends between the strands of the lower strap to lock it off…." />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-37.jpg" title="37. Then I brought the other strand to the other side…" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-38.jpg" title="38. …and did the same thing over here" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-39.jpg" title="39. Competed Mt Fuji 3TK from the back" />
<img src="assets/3TK-Mount-Fuji-40.jpg" title="40. …and from the front." />
